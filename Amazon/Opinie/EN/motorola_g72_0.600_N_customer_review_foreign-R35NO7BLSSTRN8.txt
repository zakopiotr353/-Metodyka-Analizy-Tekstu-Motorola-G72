Even with a fresh install it shows signs of lag and lack of power. I'm not sure it will keep up with eventual software updates.Camera is decent and the battery can easily last up to 3 days.It's completely sealed therefore it will be impossible to repair in the future.It's slippery and big, not easy to handle without a cover.Luckily there is little amount of bloatware and everything which is not needed can be uninstalled easily.Speaker is not loud enough and it's not pointing towards the user.The screen is nice but not bright enough.
