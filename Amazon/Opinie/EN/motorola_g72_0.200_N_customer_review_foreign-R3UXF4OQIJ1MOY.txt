At the beginning I was very impressed. Price performance sounds great at first. But after a few months, disillusionment sets in. The device just keeps getting slow. Even after deleting apps and images, the device doesn't speed up. It regularly freezes as soon as it has two tasks at the same time. E.g. Any app is running and there is a notification from Facebook or insta or or or. From that moment on, no more input is possible and the device has arrived. Even my €60 Chinese cell phone was better...embarrassing for Motorola
