I have been using the G52 for half a year now and have not had any problems or negative points. The latest Android was on board at the time, and security updates have been coming regularly. Since I also use the latest phone from another American provider, I can actually make an unfair comparison between the Motorola, which is about a quarter as expensive, and the other one. My personal conclusion: The Motorola comes off better. In standard operation, the camera is only slightly worse than the competing model (which, however, has a few additional functions in the camera), the user interface on the Motorola is much better, also thanks to the tutorials that help set it up quickly and conveniently. That doesn't happen everywhere. The gesture control (two quick “hacks” for the flashlight, two “wavs” of the wrist for the camera) is simply great: pick up the phone, gesture, done. The other phone can't do that, which is incomprehensible to me. The display is high-contrast and fast, no delays. The battery easily lasts three days with two to four hours of active use per day. The fingerprint sensor works very quickly and reliably, but I don't have facial recognition running, so I can't judge. Motorola also largely refrains from making any changes to the Android interface, which is also a plus. A few apps that I personally like to do without were pre-installed, but I don't think they should be, but they were quickly uninstalled. I had a Motorola G4 for years, outdated, but still working well, with a stable battery, etc. So it was a Motorola again.
