After some research online, I decided on the g72. I wanted a second cell phone for surfing and watching videos in bed. For me, the decisive factor is the large display, light, fast, bright, “Stock Android”. After setting it up, the frustration with the display is great. The color representation is very distorted. Delicate red tones are overlaid by a green cast in the bright areas. The color temperature is cold and the delicate tones are desaturated. In the "saturated" setting the display is absolutely unusable. For me as a hobby photographer, the monitor quality is "bad". It annoys me because with every video I watch I have the feeling that "something is not right in the representation". If you value image quality: stay away. It may be a problem with AMOLED in general, QC or the price range. That's no fun! The only thing I enjoy is the stock Android and the good speed for everyday tasks.
