I had the A33 from Samsung come for comparison. From my point of view, the only advantage of Samsung is the five years of updates and the fact that it is not a Chinese phone. But none of my cell phones have survived the two-year mark anyway. Ultimately I decided on the Moto because it's lighter and fits better in the hand - it's probably thinner too.
