I've had good experiences with the Motos for a long time (my third now) because they offer excellent performance and quality at a surprisingly low price compared to Samsung or Apple. I ordered the device and overlooked the fact that it came from Amazon's used inventory. The device was delivered quickly, could be charged and put into operation. But then it refused to charge any further and the battery level continued to drop. Chat with Amazon; friendly reference to the manufacturer: Link submitted, Amazon is waiting in the chat. Coordination with the manufacturer that the device is taken back and also assigned a reference number. So back into the chat; Amazon sent a return slip and promised that the purchase price would be refunded after the return. I ordered a new device with Prime (not used this time - it was even cheaper!) that arrived on time and works perfectly. Problem solved after 2 days.
