I bought this smartphone as a birthday present for my wife because the Huawei P10 is getting old. After a long research, I chose this Motorola Moto g72.Pro:- Very good OLED display with 6.6" screen diagonal and 120 Hz- Very smooth operation and very good performance in every standard app- Good 108 MegaPixel main camera- 128 GB of storage space with the possibility of using an SD card with a maximum of 1TB- 3.5mm headphone jack- Tidy Android 12 without unnecessary pre-installed ones Software! - Good stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos - Good connectivity with LTE (4G), Bluetooth 5.0, WLAN and NFC - Great battery with 5000 mAh that can easily last up to 2 days depending on use - With the included 33W power adapter, the smartphone is full in under 1 hour - Good fingerprint sensor in the display, fast face unlock - Case included in deliveryCons: - The case is 160.5 x 74.4 x 7.9 mm is a bit too large - Display is not scratch-resistant. It is best to order a protective glass at the same time - No 5G processor - Only lower mid-range processor in terms of values - Macro camera completely unusable - Video only Full HD Conclusion: If you are looking for a great mid-range smartphone with a great screen, good camera, good speakers, SD card and jack plug and can do without 5G, you can access it without hesitation. The included Android 12 is perfect tidy without any pointless software or ad-supported apps. For me it's an absolute price/performance tip!
