So I'm absolutely satisfied, very good sound, display top amoled, battery very good and charging quite quickly, the only thing missing is 5g and unfortunately you notice that even if you had a 5g contract and smartphone before. Nevertheless, for the price of €209, the smartphone is absolutely unrivaled and delivers more than you would expect for the price.
