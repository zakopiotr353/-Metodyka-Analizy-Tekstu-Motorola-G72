If you don't need top photos for image editing, a good device. Very good quality display, only necessary apps installed, easy to use and still handy in device size. The battery lasts me several days and is charged quickly. Overall, a good smartphone at a reasonable price. It is my second Moto and for me a good alternative to other manufacturers. To date I haven't had any defects.
