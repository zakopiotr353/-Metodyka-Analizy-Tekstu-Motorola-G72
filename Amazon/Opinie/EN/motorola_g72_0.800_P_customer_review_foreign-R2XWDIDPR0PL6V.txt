Nice b,eautyfull colored thin weighted cheap phone. Fast delivery from seller. Second hand? As new, not even a scratch. Works great do everything what my older phone does. I'm missing a little the way it was with my Moto G10. But that's me. I give it a 9/10. Works flawless for most use. I've saw reviews on youtube, tells you it's a slow phone and cam is not super? Whaat? It's NOT slow at all and camera works nice nittpickers! Cam is a lot better than my older Moto G10 and fast enough. Only personal minor is holding it in my hand, the fingerprintsensor is on the buttons instead on the back and the the homesceenbutton below. I like it more rounded with fingerprint in the middle of the back and no screenbuttons below.  That's why I like my older phone. But hey, after a while I will get used to it. ;)
