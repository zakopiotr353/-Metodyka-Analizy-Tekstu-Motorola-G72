A smartphone perfect for people with few demands.  Great camera with really good pictures. Simple and very smooth operation with the large battery of 5000. The different ringtones are not for everyone, but they are useful. I don't need facial recognition or fingerprints. It fits comfortably in the hand and even comes with a charger and a plastic protective case. Two NanoSim cards and an SD memory card can also be inserted. I'm very satisfied.  I can recommend it with a clear conscience.
