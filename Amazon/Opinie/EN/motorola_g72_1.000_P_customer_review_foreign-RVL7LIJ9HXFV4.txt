I bought the G42 for my father because he needed a new one and wasn't willing to spend a lot on a high-end device. We were very positively surprised by the performance that this smartphone delivers overall.PROS:+good and powerful display (but not very color accurate)+good camera in bright lighting conditions+astonishingly good speakers (stereo and DOLBY Atmos)+NFC (CONS: )- anyone who is used to a more expensive smartphone will find minor weaknesses everywhere, but they can be overlooked.- Software updates + security updates are questionable in the long run
