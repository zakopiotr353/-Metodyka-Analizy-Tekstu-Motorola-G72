In principle, the Motorola G22 can do everything that much more expensive mobile phones can do. Of course, some components such as the RAM or the camera are not as sophisticated or high quality as in more expensive devices. Since I bought the Motorola G22 for my uncle, who can be classified as a below-average cell phone user, this is more than enough. So far it makes a great impression, my uncle is having a lot of fun with it and is happy that he didn't have to spend huge amounts of money on his phone. I would therefore recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive cell phone that can do almost everything that such a device needs to be able to do.
