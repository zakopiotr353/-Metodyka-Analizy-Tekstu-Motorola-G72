The device was purchased as a replacement for a motorola g7 Plus. This had taken a big hit - the battery had bulged after 3 years and pushed the display out of its bond with the display. Nevertheless, I am very satisfied with all Motorola smartphones so far. It's a bit of a shame, I would have preferred to just buy a G7 Plus again and be fine. But now they're almost only available used and time goes on... it's no use. So it should be a Motorola again. Compared to previous years, the product range has unfortunately become very confusing. The following was decisive for my decision: - Motorola uses almost the standard Android from Google - I think it's great. - The smartphone has a magnetic field sensor, so it can determine the direction of the compass like a compass without GPS and a mobile network. Mandatory for navigation on foot (and also in the car if you are not moving). You have to be careful with Moto - the cheap devices often don't have a magnetic sensor. - In my opinion, the Amoled display is very bright and brilliant - It is very light (169g) and very energy efficient - Price/performance is good - 3.5mm jack connection That's not so good: - Camera is significantly worse in the dark than on the G7+ - The G52 also has stereo sound and is louder - the G7 clearly had better sound and didn't sound like that tinny - Dual SIM only works if you don't have an SD memory card - Android 12 no longer supports the standard VPN with the Fritz Box (IKE1 PSK) - that's pretty annoying, but can be compensated for using the VPNCilla APP - but that's not the fault of Motorola. - Compared to the G7PLus, the device seems less valuable.
