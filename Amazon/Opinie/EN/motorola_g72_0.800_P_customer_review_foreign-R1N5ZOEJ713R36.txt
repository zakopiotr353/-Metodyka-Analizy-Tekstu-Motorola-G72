Hello everyone, I mainly use my smartphone for work purposes, which is why I prioritize battery life and handling. I talk on the phone for about 3-4 hours a day. Surf the Internet for about 5 hours a day. I also use the camera several times a day. Occasionally Google Maps. I also use my bank APP payment method via NFC. After a 100% charge, my G72 lasts about 2.5 days without charging. The camera delivers acceptable images for the price segment. With enough lighting, the 108MP images turn out fantastic. The results are worse in darker rooms or when there is backlighting. I think the Ultra Weiwinkel is great, as it gives me a good overview even in tight spaces. Since I often have dirty fingers as a craftsman, the fingerprint is not always easily recognized. I don't have this problem with clean fingers. The fingerprint sensor is integrated into the display. Since I have a protective glass over it, could this also have a negative effect on the finger scan?!. The housing is made of plastic and looks well made. If you feel over the back of the device, you will notice slight bumps that reveal the battery underneath. But that shouldn't be a reason not to take the smartphone, as you usually use a case. Unfortunately there is only G4. But as a rule this is sufficient for normal purposes. Overall, the smartphone makes a good impression on me and it is a constant companion in my everyday work. My colleagues are always amazed when I shake the flashlight to activate it. I rediscovered Motorola as a cell phone manufacturer in 2016. Because you only ever hear about iPhone or Samsung. Function is the main focus of this device, the design... well. Buying recommendation that doesn't rely on status symbols but on a functional everyday phone, with a sharp, colorful display, good images, long battery life and great sound.
