For the price you can't complain. Workmanship and handling are very good. Display is smooth, jerk-free, good display. Camera is also very good in daylight, but in dim light it quickly reaches its limits. But you can live with that. The sound output is really good. The ringtones are terrible but there is a way to fix that. No bloatware, a bare Android 12 part. It's also worth mentioning... It's really a dual SIM cell phone! So two slots for SIM cards, PLUS a slot for an additional memory card. It's often not like that. All in all, very good price/performance ratio. Edit: The battery lasts under "normal* use (INet, Tele, WA .... No games ...)At least 3 days!!!!!!
