Since I already owned the previous Motorola moto model, there were no initial or setup problems. Since I don't use the device as intensively as many others do, I am very satisfied. I was surprised by the long battery life, which differs fundamentally from the previous model in a positive sense. However, I've only had it for 3 months and so I can't make a final judgment. Photo quality is sufficient. The fingerprint reader is located on the on/off switch and probably only reacts randomly. I haven't been able to identify any other negative features so far. I didn't like the fact that this model comes without a protective film - it's usually standard on other smartphones.
