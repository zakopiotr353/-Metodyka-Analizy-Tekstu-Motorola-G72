For the price of around 200 euros on offer, the Motorola G72 is unbeatable! I'm particularly impressed by the super-bright OLED screen and the really usable cameras. It's also fast, has 6GB of RAM and charges sufficiently quickly. The really good-sounding stereo speakers surprised me. There's simply nothing to complain about here. Only 5G, it can't do that. But I knew that before I bought it and wasn't interested. Conclusion: I still had it for the price no better smartphone. And I had a lot of them.
