I've had a few Chinese cell phones so far. Blackview, Cubot, Xiaomi... All were worlds better than the G22, and were only slightly more expensive. What Motorola has delivered here is an absolute disgrace! Unfortunately, most manufacturers can't manage to produce REAL Dual Sim cell phones with 2 Sim cards + SD card and come up with this hybrid nonsense. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have made this bad purchase here, since the G22 is at least a real dual SIM smartphone. About the G22... The terribly weak hardware is overwhelmed and shows this with jerks and occasional freezes. Smooth handling is impossible even at 90 Hz. The touch is imprecise, sluggish and does not respond to quick swipes. SD cards from other Android phones are not recognized and can only be formatted. Nothing to do with data transfer from the last Smarti. And what also really annoys me - the phone book cannot access the SIM card. You can only import it into your phone and only then access contacts! Every smartphone I know has the option to choose between internal memory or SIM. Not the G22! If you have saved new numbers and the cell phone is defective, they will be lost unless you have previously exported the contacts to an SD card or other external storage. And since the penultimate software update, the location symbol has been sporadically displayed in the status bar, even though I have disconnected all apps so that NO app should have access to the location. And even after I removed 43 bloatware and unnecessary apps, the performance has only improved slightly. I'm cured of Motorola for now.
