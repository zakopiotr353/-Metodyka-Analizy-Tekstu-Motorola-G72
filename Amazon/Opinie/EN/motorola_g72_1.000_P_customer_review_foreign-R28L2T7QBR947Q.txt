I've only had products from the Apple company for years now and have always disdainfully gossiped about Android cell phones. This mixture of ignorance and prejudice came to an end when I bought my G52 from Motorola. The main reason for me turning my back on Apple was the unspeakably weak batteries that Apple still uses in their products, compared to Android devices. Since my wife switched to Motorola about 2 years ago, she did so with the G8 Power, which has a 5000mAh battery They regularly joke about how often I had to charge my Apple. Aside from the strong battery, the G52 makes a rock-solid impression on me. With Android 12, an OS is installed that even an Apple nerd like me can get along with very well. The cell phone is fast enough for everyday use, apps load quickly and reliably. The device weighs a pleasant 185g with the included silicone case. The fingerprint sensor works reliably and quickly. Another highlight are the stereo speakers, which have an absolutely acceptable sound However, at high volumes, the device "vibrates" somewhat unpleasantly in the hand. The OLED display with full HD+ resolution is also great in this price range. The colors are rich and the black is too! The main camera takes great photos with 50 MP and if you need a selfie there is also the 16 MP front camera. What is also a pretty cool feature on Motorola are the Moto gestures. So you can activate the camera with a quick back and forth turn, or turn the flashlight on or off with the karate hand edge move. Oh, and there is also a 30-watt power supply in the box with which the G52 Ratz-Fatz can be quickly recharged if the battery ever gives up (which I haven't managed to do so far). All in all, in retrospect I wonder why I spent years buying apples that are 3 times as expensive and in terms of performance they simply don't justify this price difference. What you get here from Motorola for 250 Tacken is an absolutely good price-performance ratio that is recommended.
