I have been using the g52 for some time and am very satisfied. Fast loading is just super fast and helpful. Camera is okay but nothing special. The performance didn't let me down whether when gaming or multitasking. §.5 mm audio jack was very important to me. The fingerprint scanner was unusual at first but works perfectly. All in all, very satisfied!
