Light. Fast. Long battery life. Good display. Not offering Android 13 in mid-2023 is at least suboptimal. 14 is coming in the summer. Well then. 230 euros are fine. The battery will wear out in 2 years anyway. Samsung and co. Costs twice as much. Apart from the update speed, there is little difference to Samsung.
