The Motorola G72 takes good photos, I had an older model from Motorola where the touchscreen reacted less and less, so I decided on this newer version from Motorola, price-performance ratio is good, but here too the touchscreen does not always react perfectly, I will monitor this and possibly complain or exchange it, otherwise I am absolutely satisfied
