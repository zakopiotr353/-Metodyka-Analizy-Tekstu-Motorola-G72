Okay for the price, but no 4G as stated, slight connection problems. Compared to my previous 6-year-old cell phone (Huawei, P10 lite), some useful settings or functions are missing, such as extended screenshot, Google image editing also takes some getting used to, etc. but overall, for the price, a good device for easy use. I'll keep it for now and keep testing it.
