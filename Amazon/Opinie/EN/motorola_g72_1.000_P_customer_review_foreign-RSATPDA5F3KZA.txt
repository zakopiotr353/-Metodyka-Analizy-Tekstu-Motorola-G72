I've been using the Moto G52 for almost a year now and am still very satisfied with it. The camera is fine, the performance of the device (CPU, RAM, storage) is absolutely solid and the call and media sound quality is in no way inferior to even higher-priced devices! In addition, the system uses mostly pure Android 12, which means without an excessive number of manufacturer apps. And the apps that are pre-installed are functional and are regularly updated. However, at the moment you are still waiting in vain for the announced update to Android 13. Particularly noteworthy about this device is the battery, which gets you through the day safely even when the device is used intensively, and Motorola's own gestures, e.g Announcement to other manufacturers!
