Fulfills every wish you could have with a cell phone. Fast charging is a great bonus and really impressive. What you should of course keep in mind: The thing is already brand new, a whole Android version behind. Otherwise, you can even play many of the latest mobile phone games on it. I can't really expect more performance from a communication device. The fingerprint sensor works well. I didn't even know that the device is supposed to have "face recognition" according to Amazon, so I can't rate it accordingly. Oh yes, Android and Google spy on everything, of course, and are gigantic data octopuses, but you actually know that before you buy it, right?
