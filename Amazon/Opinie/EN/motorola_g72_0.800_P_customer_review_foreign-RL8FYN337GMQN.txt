This is a budget phone - not a high-end device. With this in mind, I want to rate it. Mechanically it is rock solid. It doesn't seem inferior in any way. The buttons work without problems, the fingerprint is recognized quite quickly and reliably. The camera takes good photos - the colors are a bit flat, but the resolution is good. The display is ok, but not particularly bright. Not very usable in direct sunlight. The overall performance is not very fast, but you can live with it if you don't want to play high-speed action games. Conclusion: You get what you can expect: a good inexpensive smartphone without any outstanding features, but also without any real problems.
