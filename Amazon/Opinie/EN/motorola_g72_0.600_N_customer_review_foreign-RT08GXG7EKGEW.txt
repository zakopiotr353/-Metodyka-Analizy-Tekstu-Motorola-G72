I really like the device. It's fast. The display is brilliant. What bothers me is the data octopus Google and the "permissions" for the apps. Big Brother sends his regards. And you are constantly “informed” about great features. Annoying.Addendum: Very annoying: The device does not have the audio code LDAC from SONY. This makes headphones worth 300 euros pointless.  LDAC has been standard since Android 8. Two stars deducted for this annoyance.November 2023: still no update to Android 13. What's going on?December 2023: Update to Android 13 has taken place.
