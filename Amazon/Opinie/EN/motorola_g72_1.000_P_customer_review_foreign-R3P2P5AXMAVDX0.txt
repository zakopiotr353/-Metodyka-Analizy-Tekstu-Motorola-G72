I was looking for a phone to replace my previous one (a Oneplus 3T) at a similar price to what I bought that for. I quickly found out that what bought me a higher mid-range device would only be enough for something barely above entry level, so I was prepared to make some compromises, but I was delighted to find that with the Moto G52 I can get a recent Android phone with a great AMOLED screen, ample storage and decent performance for everyday use.After about a month of usage the only thing I would classify as a compromise is the camera, which is only capable of the same grainy and blurry shots at low light and indoors as my 3T was.I wasn't concerned, but after reading some reviews i was definitely wary that the build quality might be lacking, but what's not obscured by the - excellent - silicone case provided in the box is more than adequate. The phone actually reminds me of the first generation Moto G I used to own which in itself says a lot considering the company was owned by none other than Google at the time.
