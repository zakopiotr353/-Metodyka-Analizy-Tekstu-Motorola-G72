I bought the Motorola moto g42 smartphone for an acquaintance who is neither particularly technically demanding nor very experienced. And in this case the device is perfect. If you are just looking for a simple device for the essential smartphone basics such as Google search, navigation, WhatsApp and email, this is the perfect place for you. Motorola is produced by Lenovo, a name in the professional sector. As far as I know, the manufacturer guarantees 2 years of Android updates, during which time you are at least on the safe side. The speed of the smartphone is absolutely sufficient, I don't notice any delays, the screen is a high-quality AMOLED and 2 SIM cards fit in. The device can be secured using a fingerprint or face scanner, neither of which have been tested. The camera is mediocre, especially in low light. The long battery life compensates for this. I chose this smartphone because, unlike Chinese brands, there is no cloud requirement or other pitfalls. The pre-installed apps are also limited. My opinion: If you are looking for a simple but sufficiently equipped and sized smartphone, you will find the lowest common denominator here. Above that it gets really expensive and below that they have to make too many concessions. The update service is particularly impressive.
