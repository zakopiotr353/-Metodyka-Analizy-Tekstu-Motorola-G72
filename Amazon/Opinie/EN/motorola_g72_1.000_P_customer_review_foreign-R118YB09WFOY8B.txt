What can I say... I've been there since the Moto G3 and I'm still a big fan of the series. I was briefly concerned because Motorola even seems to be overtaking Samsung and Apple when it comes to counting... but hey... brave new world. About the smartphone: Price/performance is great. I don't care about looks, although one could attest to a stylish and simple chic. I think the battery performance is great and the performance (don't play games, don't do streams) is definitely enough for everyday people. The fingerprint sensor sometimes has its quirks, although I don't know whether it's me or it's fault. Personally, I think the camera is great, but I don't have any graphic whore advances either. Sound is also good and the DualSim function works without any problems. If you are looking for a good device for everyday use, with enough memory, DualSim, a pleasant size and absolutely sufficient battery power, this is the right place for you.
