A mid-range phone at a good price. Easy installation. Data transfer from my old Motorola worked smoothly. No unnecessary advertising apps, smooth operating system. Complete the entire installation process and testing phase in one day with just one phone charge. On the second day still 45% battery power.  The camera system is completely sufficient for my needs. Not 5G but I knew that. It's all ok.
