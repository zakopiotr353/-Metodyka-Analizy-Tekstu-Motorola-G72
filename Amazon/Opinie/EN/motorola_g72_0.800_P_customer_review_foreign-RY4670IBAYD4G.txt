I've been using models from the Moto series for years and returned with regret after a short trip to another manufacturer's galaxy. The Moto g72 also offers a solid price-performance ratio. The battery life is good. The camera isn't great (you can't expect it for the price), but it's sufficient for my needs. However, there is a big minus point for the WiFi reception. It shouldn't be that the connection breaks off 3 meters away from the router - I didn't have any problems like that with the previous models.
