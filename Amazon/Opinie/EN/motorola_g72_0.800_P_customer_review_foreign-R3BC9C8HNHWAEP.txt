I bought the phone on sale. I'm very satisfied. Especially since my old darling (born in 2016) left a lot to be desired. I had to get used to the speed and sensitivity of the screen. Also the size. Dubbing photos from the old cell phone = disaster. Sorting even newly taken pictures = just as terrible. The necessary sorting functions are simply not there. The camera itself is good. But otherwise: great.
