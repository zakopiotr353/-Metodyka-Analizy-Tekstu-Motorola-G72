Unfortunately, today's smartphones are almost the size of a tablet, but the device can't do anything about that; I didn't have to order it. Overall, I'm happy with the g52. The screen delivers a good picture, the sound is completely ok on the ear and with hands-free calling and the apps run quickly. However, I have two buts: The device very often breaks off the connection to the WLAN and switches to the mobile network, sometimes several times a minute. The ability to suffer for weak signals is probably set incorrectly. I don't know whether this is a problem with the device itself or a bug in Android 12. On the other hand, I am very dissatisfied with the camera. The images are blurry and pixelated. Again, I don't know if it's Motorola's problem or if an app could solve the problem. However, I expect the native camera to deliver acceptable results from a device in this price range. Since I mostly just take snapshots or note photos, sending the phone back isn't dramatic enough, but it's still annoying. The battery lasts long and charges very quickly. Fingerprint and facial recognition are great. I'll probably keep it, but I wouldn't buy it again.
