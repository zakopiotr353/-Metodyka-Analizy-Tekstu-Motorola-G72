In my opinion, the smartphone is unbeatable for this price, it can do everything it needs to and is really inexpensive. The battery lasts all day even with increased use and charging is pretty quick. The fingerprint sensor is located on the right side of the power button and works reliably. I've had good experiences with Motorola, my last smartphone (Moto 5g s plus) lasted 5 years and would certainly have worked even longer if I hadn't dropped it too often. The durability is really no comparison to iPhone and co, and on top of that the price is many times lower.
