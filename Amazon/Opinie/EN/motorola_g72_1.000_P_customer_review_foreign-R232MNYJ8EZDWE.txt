I decided on the Moto G52 as a replacement for my older Moto G6 because I've been very happy with it so far. I'm not a technology freak and don't need a high-end device. The G52 largely meets my needs, even if the camera leaves something to be desired. Maybe I haven't found the right settings yet, but the images could actually be better, especially in poorer lighting conditions. The selfie camera, on the other hand, is good and the self-timer for "smile detection" works. The fingerprint sensor, which is now attached to the on/off head (like many other competitors), takes a little getting used to. I was used to it differently and needed to change, but that's not a problem. The display is really great in my opinion. Also, as is usual for Motorola, the G52 is not overloaded with pre-installed apps. I haven't tried facial recognition yet, so I can't say anything about it. So far there is no update to Android 13, which is a shame, but maybe that will come. If I have any more negative experiences, I will adjust the review.
