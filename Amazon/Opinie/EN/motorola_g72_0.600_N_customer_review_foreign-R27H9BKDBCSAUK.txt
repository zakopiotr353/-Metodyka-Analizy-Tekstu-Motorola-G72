What can you say? Reviews great, real, well, not that great. Display and fingerprint sensor work, even with display protection. That was also the positive! The AF just twitches, the AI ​​is a joke, the reception has a cough, the 2.5ver jack only plays one channel, apps twitch when you start and it takes you 3 hours to set it up. to deactivate all the activated Google crap so that your last visit to the toilet doesn't end up on these data thieves' servers. I can't recommend it, I'd rather get a direct Chinese part with more current Android that works, even though Motorola is only Chinese, but worse.
