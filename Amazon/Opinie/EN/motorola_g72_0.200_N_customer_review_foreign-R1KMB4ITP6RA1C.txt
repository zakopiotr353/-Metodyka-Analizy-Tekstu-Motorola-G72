Seal was already opened when it arrived. Well, I started setting it up anyway. Unfortunately, the device not only didn't recognize my WiFi, but it didn't find any WiFi signals at all. And that in the city. It also switched itself off several times, even though it was just lying on the table. Unfortunately, it's going back!
