As the title suggests - unfortunately the smartphone gave up after about 8 months of moderate use. Before, it did a very good job - I found the camera to be solid (I'm a photographer and use my phone for snapshots), battery life was great, touchscreen and gestures were very responsive. I actually thought I had finally found a reliable manufacturer that wouldn't bombard me with advertising. The very friendly telephone service from Motorola confirmed to me that a repair would not be effective and that I would have to have the device scrapped via Amazon (at least there is a money back).
