The phone itself is great. Valuable and very good facilities. But why did it go back? The camera. This means the SelfiCam, the main camera, takes good pictures. Completely normal. The front camera, however, isn't that great and uses it on everything despite the beauty filter being switched off. btw yes you can turn it off. Gives the camera more options when you slide up. It took forever to figure this out, but it activates itself
