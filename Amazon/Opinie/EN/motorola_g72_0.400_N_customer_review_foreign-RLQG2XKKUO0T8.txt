Short and painful:++++ Display++ Battery ---- Video playback Basically, I bought this smartphone because of the POLED display. If I were to rate it for that alone, it would be a full 5 stars. However, you have to do some kind of activity with the display in order for it to be effective. I mainly use YouTube for this, which shows very nice, clean and sharp colors on the display even without 10bit color depth (per channel). At least to my eyes, there is hardly anything that can be improved in terms of pixel density and sharpness. However, when playing the videos, there are regularly severe jerks in the image reproduction. There are no other programs running in the background, apart from all the background applications over which the user has little influence anyway. 105GB of storage is also still free. I am connected to the Internet via 5GHz WiFi. Auto-updates are activated and everything is up to date. Sometimes it helps to close the YouTube app and restart it, sometimes it doesn't. There is also a 20-page thread (for the G71) in the Lenovo forum, with no apparent solution. It can't be that a smartphone from 2022 stalls when playing very simple videos. My old Motorola G5, which comes with significantly weaker electronics, doesn't have this problem. The whole thing is very frustrating.
