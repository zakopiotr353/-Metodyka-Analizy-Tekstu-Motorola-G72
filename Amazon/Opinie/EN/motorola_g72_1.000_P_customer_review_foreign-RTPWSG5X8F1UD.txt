A solid phone at a very good price. Switching from Sony Xperia to Motorola. The setup was super quick and without any complications. The operation is also similar and I quickly got used to Motorola. I've been using it for almost two weeks, haven't discovered everything yet, but I feel very comfortable with the phone. Recommended for anyone who is simply looking for a good cell phone, with plenty of storage space for games and apps and a really good camera for everyday use.
