We ordered the Moto G22 because there was a picture on Amazon's website that advertised that a fitness watch was included. Unfortunately, we discovered that it wasn't included. After a phone call with customer service, it turned out that it was probably just an advertising campaign from the manufacturer. In my opinion, Amazon should take a look at what they use for advertising images. Now about the phone itself: Well, it's a smartphone with which you can make calls, take photos, etc. It's quite fast and has a good display resolution. The photos are pretty decent, but with a strong zoom the picture isn't very attractive. As far as the phone/speaking quality is concerned, we can't really say anything yet. If anything comes up, we'll update it here.
