The phone itself is great for the price. But the camera is not good. Not just in terms of quality, but also in terms of workmanship. Sometimes I take a photo of something and 10 minutes later I realize it didn't save the image at all. This especially happens in nightwear. Apps like Spotify often freeze or crash when I take a photo. The cell phone also has weaknesses when making calls. Often I don't hear the person I'm talking to or the other person doesn't hear me.
