I only use the cell phone for making calls, writing and occasionally playing games. The smartphone is well made and feels good in the hand. The FHD display is sharp and the cell phone has enough power for everyday use and not too demanding games. What I didn't like: - the camera wasn't good despite its 108 megapixels, it took a long time to focus - after less than two years I couldn't charge the smartphone anymore and it got extremely hot.
