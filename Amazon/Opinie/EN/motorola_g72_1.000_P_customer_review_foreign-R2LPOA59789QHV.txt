After my wife's Moto G5+ ran out of battery after 5 years and the battery of my Moto one vision also started to weaken and we have always been extremely satisfied with Motorola, we ordered a Moto G72 for both of us. Setting it up via Hey Google worked without any problems and after half an hour accounts, apps and data were on the new phone. After 2 days of use, there is only one conclusion for me and my wife... "PERFECT". Great display, fast and smooth. Storage space after setup Approx. 100 GB free which can also be expanded with an external memory card. This is no longer possible with most new and expensive cell phones. We have 256 GB cards in there and they work great. Good sound, good reception. and voice quality when making calls.Great cam for all situationsBattery easily lasts two days under normal useThe scope of delivery includes a 33W quick charger with cable, a USB plug for the cigarette lighter in the car and a transparent cell phone case.We can absolutely recommend this cell phone!
