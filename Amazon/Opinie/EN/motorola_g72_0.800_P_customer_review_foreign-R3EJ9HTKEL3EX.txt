I ordered the g42 and made sure beforehand that the update to Android 13 was planned. About a year after the phone was released, this is still not the case. It often takes a few months until security updates are released. The fact that the WiFi becomes completely unstable when Bluetooth is switched on plays a minor role. Otherwise the device is quite usable, the battery is ok, I don't care more or less about the camera. Just standard. I would describe the display as good; I don't notice any flickering. There is no bloatware either. Addendum: now, at the beginning of December 2023, the update to Android 13 is here. It also seems to me that the updates are a little faster now.
