I have a 5-year-old Motorola, which still works perfectly today. Because of the good experiences I've had with it, I didn't hesitate for long to buy this model. Well, times change - as does the quality of this manufacturer. Wi-Fi reception is significantly worse than with a 5-year-old LG Nexus! It's so slow that you get the impression that something is broken... Apps keep closing on their own (or do they crash?). Fingerprint sensor - who puts this in the power button?!? and why? My wife's Apple should be replaced with this model. After a more than bumpy setup/updates, she's no longer interested in it. I'll try to return this crap....
