I gave this smartphone as a birthday present. Thought you can't ask for much at that price. When unpacking it was a big surprise. 1m charging cable and 33 watt charging plug, matching case and enough information sheets were all included. I bought the 128GB version and 6GB of RAM. When it comes to the software and hardware, I wasn't sure whether this was the right one for a smartphone owner who takes photos and surfs the Internet. But after all the updates and installing apps, the smartphone works very quickly. The camera is very bad at first but after the update it is very good. Of course it can't be compared with a top-class smartphone, but it's very good. Macro lens could have been a little better but due to the price you have to make compromises here. This smartphone can play games like Mario Kart from the Playstore that require a little more graphics without stuttering. Conclusion: For smartphone seekers with the desire to spend little, this Motorola is a good choice. Because everything you need is there.
