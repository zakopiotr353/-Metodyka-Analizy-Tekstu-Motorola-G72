Good phone with an above average camera (but not spectacular).Was a fan of the original Nokia (Windows) but the subsequent Nokias were pretty standard and too pricey.I'm not a fan of the i-phone 'cult'.Also, the socket for the charger on my last Nokia phone went bust twice so after a £45 repair bill and it going wrong again, I opted for the Motorola.  I bought a second Motorola for use in Slovakia where I work and no technical problems so far and good operability.
