I was once again looking for a cheap cell phone with as little bloatware as possible pre-installed. I'm only a casual user of Chrome, Youtube, Whatsapp, Spotify, camera and that's it. The performance is always sufficient for this. So for the price of well under €200 it's a really good device. Oh yes, I've never had a fingerprint sensor on the power button before and I think it's pretty good. Delivery from Amazon was quick as always. So I can highly recommend it.
