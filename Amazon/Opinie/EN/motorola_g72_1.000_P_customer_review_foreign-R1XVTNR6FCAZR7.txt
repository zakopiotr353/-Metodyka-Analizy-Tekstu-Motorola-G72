I now had enough time to adjust and tune the phone to my needs. It's my third android. First of all, I would like to point out the battery that feels like it lasts forever. Once it's down to 25%, it quickly goes back up again using a quick charger. The screen always offers a clear, bright view thanks to its adaptive brightness adjustment. No need to switch on night mode. Everything is ready for use quickly. Nothing jerks or jerks. Videos run smoothly and my photo stream looks almost like it does on my home 4k monitor. I only checked the built-in camera to make sure it was working properly, because as a hobby photographer I have equipment that no smartphone in the world can beat. There is plenty of memory. Even without the additional 64 GB SD I donated, there wouldn't be any panic so quickly :-) The fingerprint sensor is also very good. A finger placed at the side is recognized and everything is available almost immediately. The device fits well in the hand and the icons do not react overly sensitively. I would describe the sound as satisfactory, but I prefer listening to “Götterdämmerung” on my home system :-) Many interested readers will now be amazed: you can even make phone calls with it. So if you're looking for a mid-range device, the Motorola is the perfect choice. You really get a usable piece of electronics at a very manageable price.
