Motorola is in the hands of Lenovo, which I appreciate for building high-quality PCs and notebooks, especially in the business sector. The striking advantages from my point of view are straight away => 1) Two years of security updates can be described as outstanding, especially in this price range. Can keep up with much more expensive models. The camera takes decent pictures even in low light, which is also not a given in this segment. Of course, you shouldn't expect miracles, overall it's absolutely sufficient. Negative or positive is the low weight of the smartphone. The housing is completely made of plastic, as are the switches on the edge. The choice of cases is extremely limited. For example, I didn't find any in real leather. The battery life is generous and should satisfy every user. Charging is breathtakingly fast with the included charger; the device probably doesn't even need 30 minutes from 0% to 70%. I didn't measure it, but it seemed extremely fast to me. An exclusion criterion for many readers could be the lack of "5G", the new and super-fast standard for mobile data transmission. Cheaper models from the manufacturer have it, the Motorola Moto g72 doesn't, which is surprising. This may also be the reason why the device is so cheap. You can install a maximum of one SIM card and optionally a MicroSD.* My opinion: If you don't need 5G, in my opinion 4G is almost always sufficiently fast, you should get it here. The overall package of the Motorola Moto g72 is unique for the price. Above all, you get a top screen along with a long battery life. Also a clean Android operating system. I read in a review that there were Bluetooth problems. I couldn't find this.
