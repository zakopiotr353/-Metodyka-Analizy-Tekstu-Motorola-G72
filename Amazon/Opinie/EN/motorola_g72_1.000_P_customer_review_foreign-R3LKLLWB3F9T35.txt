+ Great AMOLED screen with 120hz and strong brightness+ great stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos and good volume+ huge 5000mah battery 🔋 easily lasts two days with intensive use+ good camera in the price range except for night photography+ software: Stock Android with useful extensions+ 33w quick charger is included, relatively quick charging times - not particularly powerful processor - case only made of plastic - mediocre Vibratinsmotor - Just a big update to Android 13 I already had a few higher-priced devices and only wanted to switch to the device for a short time, but I'm so satisfied that I'll probably stick with it for now
