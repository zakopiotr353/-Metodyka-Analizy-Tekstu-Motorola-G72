The cell phone works well and can be rated as very good in this price range. It was important to me to find a cell phone with a good camera. That's why I tested the following cell phones:OUKITEL C32: returned - camera not goodBlackview A100: returned - camera not good, Android 11 out of date - security update more than 1 year old!!!Samsung A13: kept - camera about as good as Moto g22In my opinion, the Moto g22 is just as good as the Samsung A13 - I couldn't find any major differences in terms of speed, software, etc. The fact that I kept the Samsung and not the g22 was due to my convenience - I previously had a Samsung - so I didn't have to change to a new arrangement of the apps and the quick menu. The other two cell phones are far behind and significantly worse than the g22! If you're looking for a good, inexpensive cell phone with which you can take useful photos on vacation, the Moto g22 is certainly a good choice.
