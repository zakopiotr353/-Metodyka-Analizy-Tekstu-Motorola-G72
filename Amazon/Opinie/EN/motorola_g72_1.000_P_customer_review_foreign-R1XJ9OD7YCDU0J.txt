The Moto G42 is really a great device. Especially at the offer price, you can get a great smartphone with a good OLED display, a good camera and a 5000mAh battery for little money. The feel is good, the device is only 8mm thin. It also comes with almost pure Android 12, which is something only Google offers with its Pixel devices. No unnecessary apps. It will also get an update to the latest Android 13. For me, it's a suitable device that doesn't jerk when used and lasts a long time. Absolute purchase recommendation
