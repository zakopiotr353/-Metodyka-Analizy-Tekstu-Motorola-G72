This is the the slowest, glitchy-est phone I have had for a long time.I had the previous Motorola which was great but due to a cracked screen thought I may as well upgrade instead of just buying a new screen - but this is terrible in comparison.  I wrongly thought newer phones would only be better, or at least not worse than their predecessors but this is unbelievably slow to load - everything - it doesn't even register calls coming in sometimes as it can't keep up the screen just goes blank and you can't see who is calling.  Apps close down or take an age to open.Google Maps is far too fast for it - which is not great when you need to adjust something whilst driving...No idea how this model made it off of the production line
