This time I decided on a Motorola cell phone because I had read good reviews and it was good value for money. At around 230€ you get a powerful cell phone for normal use. The power supply and case were supplied directly by Motorola, which I think is very good. The handling after a few weeks is very good and the Motorola function is very useful and helpful. The Android is almost pure, so it is not cluttered with apps that no one needs. I didn't rate the facial recognition because I don't use this function. Conclusion: I would buy the cell phone again at this price and be completely satisfied
