It is a great phone. Nice screen, software works well.Pictures are great with the camera.I love the total look and feel.But I didn't clearly see it wasn't new and the worst thing is that it can take me 6 hours or 2 days to charge it.I have tried everything, all apps are turned off, but it still won't always charge. Bought a new charger since that was missing, but it still doesn't work. Very dissapointing, therefor only 1 star.Update 10/7/2024:The phone stopt charching now. Really dont' buy this. Only buy this phone if it is new!
