For a price of just over €200, you can't fault this device at all. In my opinion. The battery is long-lasting and the performance is more than sufficient for everyday things like social media and surfing the Internet or YouTube. But of course you can't make the same demands as on a 1000 € device... I bought the cell phone as a birthday present and the owner is more than happy with it.
