The phone works fine when the screen is unlocked.The quality of the camera is pretty bad regardless of what resolution setting you use.If the phone has been in standby for too long, when you open it all background tasks seem to wake up, causing lots of lag and all your notifications to go off for apps which are unoptimised battery.GPS only works if the screen is unlocked, regardless of any settings.  Contacted Motorola, but I was told to factory reset it and this made no difference.  Both Google Maps, ski tracker and Strava suffer from this issue.  Many people have similar issues if you check Motorola / Lenovo forums.I have given it 2 starts as I'm still using the phone, but I will be changing to something else once I can afford.I think these issues are all software related, as people reviewed the phone with android 11 are happier than the new v12 OS ones.
