After 3 attempts, with a Chinese product in the same price range and highly praised in the media, I am satisfied. Here it works the way I was used to from the good old Apple, Huawei, etc. times. The fingerprint sensor, screen, etc. works without me having to go to university again at my age. In order not to leave the wrong impression, this Motorola is about my 25th device, including work cell phones. mfg
