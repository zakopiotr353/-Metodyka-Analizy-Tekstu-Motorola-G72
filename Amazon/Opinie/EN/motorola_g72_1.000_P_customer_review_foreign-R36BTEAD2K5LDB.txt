At the beginning of February I treated myself to the Motorola G72. I actually didn't plan on getting a new smartphone yet because my Samsung A52s 5G isn't showing its age yet. However, the cheap offer here on Amazon for the Motorola was simply too tempting. I then retired the Samsung. Despite the larger display (excellent OLED display), the G72 is much more manageable. It's thinner, lighter and not as bulky as my Samsung. In addition, it reacts much more quickly when you pick it up; a double tap on the display to wake it up is usually no longer necessary. And most importantly for me, it has an amazingly long battery life. Conclusion: everything was done right.
