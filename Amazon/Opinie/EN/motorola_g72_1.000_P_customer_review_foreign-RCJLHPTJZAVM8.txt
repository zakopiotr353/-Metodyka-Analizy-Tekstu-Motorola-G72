I wanted a cell phone with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a large display and a good camera for under €400. (I would have preferred a Google Pixel because of the camera's good reputation. But the missing 3.5 mm jack and the somewhat small display of the Pixel 6A made me keep looking). The Motorola G72 can do everything I need. For the price, the camera is really satisfactory.
